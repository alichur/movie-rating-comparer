Compare IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes ratings

This app is just a way for me to become familiar with hybrid app development and the tools Ionic2, Angular2, and Typescript.
Currently on hold waiting for API key from Rotten Tomatoes https://www.rottentomatoes.com/help_desk/proposalform

TODOs: Tests, error handling.
